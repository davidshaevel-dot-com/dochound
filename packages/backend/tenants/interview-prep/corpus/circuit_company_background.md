## Executive Summary

**Circuit** is building the world's first AI-powered knowledge network for manufacturing and industrial enterprises. They help manufacturers and their supply chain networks (distributors, service providers, suppliers) share complex technical information securely, clearly, and efficiently.

**The One-Liner:** Circuit makes technical knowledge searchable, understandable, and useful through AI.

## The Problem Circuit Solves

### The Knowledge Bottleneck

Manufacturers face a critical communication challenge:

1. **Vast Technical Documentation** - Product specs, manuals, drawings, compliance docs
2. **Distributed Networks** - Dealers, distributors, technicians, suppliers all need access
3. **Information Silos** - Critical knowledge trapped in PDFs, emails, legacy systems
4. **Slow Adoption** - Manufacturing is often last to adopt modern software tools

**The Pain Points:**
- Technicians can't find answers in massive documentation sets
- Sales teams struggle with complex product configurations (CPQ)
- Partners lack up-to-date technical information
- Support teams manually search through thousands of documents

### Why This Matters

When a field technician can't find the right spec, equipment stays broken. When a sales rep can't configure a product correctly, deals fall through. When partners have outdated information, relationships suffer.

**Circuit's insight:** The manufacturing sector has been underserved by AI/software tools. They're the "slow adopter economy" - and that's an opportunity.
