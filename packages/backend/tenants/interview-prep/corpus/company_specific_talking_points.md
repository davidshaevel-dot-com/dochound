## Circuit - Principal Frontend Engineer

### Company Overview

- **Industry:** Manufacturing AI - "world's first manufacturing-focused AI knowledge platform"
- **Founded by:** Former Silicon Labs executives (Tyson Tuttle - CEO, Oivind Loe - CTO)
- **Location:** Downtown Austin (on-site)
- **Why this opening:** Current Principal FE was promoted
- **Compensation:** $180k base + bonus + equity

### Why Circuit? (Customize your answer)

> "I'm excited about Circuit for several reasons. First, the manufacturing AI space is genuinely interesting to me - it's a domain where AI can have tangible, measurable impact on operations. Second, the leadership team's background from Silicon Labs signals deep domain expertise. Third, the fact that the previous Principal Frontend Engineer was promoted internally tells me there's real career growth here. And finally, the tech stack - TypeScript, React, modern testing practices - aligns perfectly with how I believe frontend should be built."

### Your Experience Aligned to Circuit

**React/TypeScript at Scale:**
> "At Walmart, I built a productivity dashboard in React/TypeScript that was adopted by 50+ engineering teams. I focused on component reusability, type safety, and performance. The scale taught me to think carefully about state management and rendering optimization."

**Testing Philosophy:**
> "I believe strongly in the testing pyramid - unit tests for business logic, integration tests for component interactions, and E2E tests for critical user flows. At Walmart, I worked with Jest and React Testing Library. I'm excited to work with Vitest and Playwright - Vitest's speed makes TDD much more practical, and Playwright's cross-browser testing is excellent for ensuring consistent UX."

**Monorepo Experience:**
> "I've worked with monorepo structures using both npm workspaces and similar tooling. I understand the benefits - shared dependencies, atomic commits across packages, unified CI - and the challenges - build times, dependency management, and tooling complexity. I'm familiar with Turborepo's caching approach and Nx's computation caching."

**AI Product Interest:**
> "Manufacturing AI is compelling because the problems are concrete and measurable. If an AI system helps engineers find specifications faster or reduces defect rates, you can quantify that impact. I built an MCP server at Zello's hackathon that integrated AI with developer workflows - I understand both the potential and the practical challenges of AI integration."

### Questions to Ask Circuit

1. "What does the Principal Frontend Engineer's day-to-day look like? How much time is architecture vs. hands-on coding vs. mentoring?"
2. "How does the frontend team collaborate with the AI/ML team? What does that interface look like?"
3. "What's your approach to design systems? Do you have one established, or is that something to build?"
4. "What's the most challenging frontend problem you've solved recently?"
5. "How do you balance new feature development with technical debt and testing improvements?"

### Circuit Red Flags to Probe

- On-site only - clarify expectations around hours and flexibility
- Startup stage - ask about runway and growth trajectory
- "Principal" title - clarify scope and autonomy

## Emporia Research - Full-Stack Software Engineer

### Company Overview

- **Industry:** B2B Market Research
- **Clients:** Amazon, Meta, Google
- **Funding:** VC-backed (NYC and Boston investors)
- **Location:** "The Yard" (south of downtown Austin)
- **Compensation:** $180k base

### Why Emporia Research? (Customize your answer)

> "Emporia Research stands out to me for a few reasons. First, the client list - Amazon, Meta, Google - indicates you're solving real problems at scale. Second, the tech stack is exactly what I want to work with: modern AWS serverless architecture, AI/LLM integration with LangChain and Bedrock, and the full TypeScript stack. Third, I'm drawn to the B2B research space because the problems are intellectually interesting - extracting insights from unstructured data, building systems that help people make better decisions."

### Your Experience Aligned to Emporia

**AWS Serverless Architecture:**
> "While my primary cloud experience has been with Azure at Walmart and multi-cloud at Zello, I've studied AWS serverless patterns extensively. The concepts transfer directly - Lambda is like Azure Functions, DynamoDB is like Cosmos DB, Step Functions is like Logic Apps. I understand single-table DynamoDB design, Lambda cold starts and optimization, and serverless architectures. At Zello, I used Terraform for infrastructure as code across AWS, GCP, and IBM Cloud."

**AI/LLM Integration:**
> "At Zello's hackathon, I built an MCP server that integrated with internal systems. I've studied RAG architectures - the combination of vector search for retrieval and LLMs for generation. I understand embeddings, chunking strategies, and the trade-offs between different approaches. LangChain's abstraction over different LLM providers makes sense for a company that might want to switch between Claude, GPT-4, and Llama based on cost or capability needs."

**Full-Stack TypeScript:**
> "I've worked across the full stack with TypeScript - React frontends at Walmart, Node.js services at Zello. Type safety across the entire stack is powerful - shared types between frontend and backend eliminate a whole class of bugs. I understand both the React ecosystem (hooks, state management, testing) and Node.js patterns (async/await, error handling, API design)."

**Startup Experience:**
> "At Zello, I experienced the startup pace - wearing multiple hats, making decisions with incomplete information, balancing speed and quality. I understand that in a growing company, you sometimes need to ship quickly and iterate, and other times you need to invest in architecture that will scale."

### Questions to Ask Emporia

1. "How does the AI/LLM integration work in your product? What are the main use cases?"
2. "What's your approach to data quality and research accuracy? How do you ensure the insights are reliable?"
3. "What does the development process look like? How do you balance feature development with platform improvements?"
4. "What's the team structure? How do engineers collaborate with researchers or domain experts?"
5. "What's the biggest technical challenge you're facing right now?"

### Emporia Red Flags to Probe

- Startup risk - ask about funding runway and growth metrics
- B2B market research - understand the market dynamics
- AWS-heavy stack - be honest about learning curve while emphasizing transferable skills
