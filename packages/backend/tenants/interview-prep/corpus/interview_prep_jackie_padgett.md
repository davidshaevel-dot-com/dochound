## Key Messages to Convey

### 1. Why Circuit?
> "I'm drawn to Circuit for three reasons. First, manufacturing AI is a domain where technology has tangible, measurable impact - helping engineers find specifications faster or reducing support response times are outcomes I can get excited about. Second, the founding team's background from Silicon Labs signals deep domain expertise - you're not just building generic AI, you're solving real manufacturing problems. Third, the collaborative, low-ego culture you describe matches how I work best."

### 2. Why This Role?
> "I've spent recent years on infrastructure and DevOps, but my passion is building user-facing products. The Principal Frontend Engineer role lets me return to that while bringing the operational mindset I've developed. I love turning complex systems into intuitive experiences - that's exactly what Circuit is doing with manufacturing documentation."

### 3. Why Now?
> "I'm at a point in my career where I want to see the direct impact of my work. At Walmart, I built platforms that served 1,900+ users, but I was one step removed from the end customer. I want to be closer to the product and the people using it."

## Likely Questions & Answers

### "Tell me about yourself"
> "I'm a frontend-focused engineer with experience across the full stack. Most recently at Zello, I worked on infrastructure across multiple clouds - AWS, GCP, IBM Cloud - using Terraform, Docker, and Kubernetes. Before that, at Walmart, I built a React/TypeScript dashboard that was adopted by 50+ engineering teams. What energizes me is turning complex problems into intuitive user experiences. I'm drawn to Circuit because manufacturing AI is a space where that kind of work has real, measurable impact."

### "What do you know about Circuit?"
> "Circuit is building the first manufacturing-focused AI knowledge platform. You're helping industrial companies transform how they sell, support, and collaborate with their networks - turning complex product documentation into actionable workflows. The founding team comes from Silicon Labs, so you have deep manufacturing domain expertise. I saw you were at the Texas Women's Leadership Conference recently - it seems like building a strong culture is a priority from day one."

### "What kind of culture do you thrive in?"
> "I thrive in cultures with high ownership and low ego. I like having autonomy to make decisions while being accountable for outcomes. I appreciate teams that value collaboration over hierarchy - where the best idea wins regardless of who suggested it. I also value cultures that invest in their people and communities, which I can see Circuit does based on your leadership team's involvement in Austin nonprofits."

### "How do you handle ambiguity?"
> "I start by clarifying the goal, even if the path isn't clear. At Zello, we discovered mid-migration that an IBM Cloud service was being deprecated sooner than expected. I quickly assessed alternatives, proposed a migration plan to AWS equivalents, and reorganized priorities. We hit the deadline without impacting other commitments. Ambiguity is uncomfortable, but it's also where the most interesting problems live."

### "Tell me about a time you collaborated across teams"
> "At Walmart, I built a productivity dashboard that required input from multiple engineering teams. I ran discovery sessions to understand what metrics mattered to different teams, then iterated on the design with their feedback. The key was treating them as partners, not just users. The dashboard ended up being adopted by 50+ teams because they felt ownership in its creation."

### "What questions do you have for me?"
